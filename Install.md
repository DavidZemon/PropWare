Installation
============

Microsoft Windows
-----------------
I'm sorry to say, there is a bug in the CMake files and PropWare is not currently usable on any Microsoft Windows 
operating system. If you'd like to get ready for PropWare though, go ahead and download/install any version of Python
2.7+ from [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You'll need it for the installation script.

Linux
-----
Most, if not all, Linux distributions ship with a version of Python, so don't worry about that. Simply download PropWare
in any way that you like (Git is recommended, but a 
[binary distribution](http://david.zemon.name/downloads/PropWare_Binaries/) from here will work just fine) and execute
the INSTALL.py script. If you downloaded PropWare to `/home/david/PropWare`, you would open a terminal and type:

    cd /home/david/PropWare/util
    python INSTALL.py

You might see some questions pop up - just answer them as your heart desires. Since I'm still very new to this, _please_
[let me know](mailto:david@zemon.name) if there is anything confusing about my wording.

When you're all done, exit the terminal. If you opted to set root environment variables, you'll need to reboot your 
computer before PropWare is usable.

Mac OSX
-------
I have _no_ idea what will happen on a Mac. I don't own a Mac. If you are reading this and you have a Mac, I'd greatly
appreciate you [getting in contact with me](mailto:david@zemon.name) to help me iron out any existing bugs in the 
installation script. You don't have to have any prerequisite knowledge to help - I just need something to test on.
