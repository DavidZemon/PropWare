    <h1>CMake &amp; Make Overview</h1>

    <h2>What is CMake?</h2>

    <p>CMake is a Makefile generator. CMake will scan your source code and, based on some predefined rules,
      generate <code>Make</code> scripts. Using Cmake is a two-step process: first generate the Makefiles,
      then compile your code by invoking <code>Make</code> on the Makefiles. CMake documentation can be
      found on <a href="http://cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html">cmake.org</a></p>

    <h2>What is Make?</h2>

    <p>Make is a much older tool that will, at its core, incrementally compile your code. This simply means that
      if
      you have a project with two files (<code>cat.c</code> and <code>dog.c</code>), and a change is made to
      <code>cat.c</code>, then only <code>cat.c</code> will be re-compiled. Lots of different flavors of Make
      have been developed over the years including GNU, MinGW, Ninja, and more - but we will focus on GNU
      since
      that is what ships with the Windows version of PropGCC and comes with most Linux operating systems.
      GNU's
      Make documentation can be found on
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/index.html">gnu.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>Two command line instructions are all you need to get started:</p>

    <pre><code hljs hljs-no-escape hljs-language="sh">cmake -G &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; &lt;source directory&gt;
make</code></pre>

    <p>Breakdown:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code>cmake -G &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; &lt;source directory&gt;</code>: Here we perform the
          first
          step - generating the Makefiles. CMake will scan your source directory, read your source files
          to
          discover dependencies (like header files), and create one or more files named “Makefile”.</p>
        <p>The first argument, <code>-G &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot;</code>, tells CMake exactly what flavor
          of
          Make we're using. As reasoned in the <code>What is Make?</code> section above, we will always be
          using <code>Unix Makefiles</code> for PropWare projects.</p>
        <p>The second argument is the source directory of your project. This directory must contain a
          <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file as described in step 1 of
          <a href="#/rreference/build-system">Creating a PropWare
            Application</a>. I prefer to run “out of source” builds - which means I create a new folder
          within my project where all of my generated and compiled files will end up. Generally, I name
          this
          folder <code>bin</code>. With this simple case, the complete command to generate the Makefiles
          would be <code>cmake -G &quot;Unix Makefiles&quot; ..</code>. The <code>..</code> is a
          cross-platform way of saying “the directory above me”. For reference: <code>.</code> refers to
          the current directory.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code>make</code>: Make is old, flexible, and great. CMake has done all the work though and no
          extra
          arguments are needed for this command. After successfully running CMake, simply type <code>make
          </code> - character for character. When it completes successfully, your project will have been
          compiled into its binary format, ready to be programmed to your Propeller. %PropWare provides
          some extra “targets” to make your life even easier though. Try typing <code>make debug</code> to
          write your program to RAM and open a terminal (like Parallax's PST) or <code>make run</code> to
          write your program to EEPROM.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CMakeLists.txt</h2>

    <p>As described in <a href="http://david.zemon.name/PropWare/md_docs_Ch4AppDeployment.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>,
      the
      CMakeLists.txt file is required for all CMake (and therefore %PropWare) applications. The file must be
      named “CMakeLists.txt” - character for character.</p>

    <p>The contents of the file are simple - many useful tips can be gleaned from both
      <a href="http://david.zemon.name/PropWare/md_docs_Ch4AppDeployment.xhtml">Creating a PropWare
        Application</a> and
      <a href="http://david.zemon.name/PropWare/md_docs_AppACMakeForPropware.xhtml">CMake for PropWare</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>CMakeCache.txt</h2>

    <p>I won't hold back - CMakeCache.txt can be a royal pain. CMake keeps track of your settings in this file
      and,
      a lot of times, you might change a setting without CMake taking notice. When this happens, just delete
      the
      <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file and rerun your CMake command (as given above). As a bonus to using the
      out-of-source build technique you can also just delete your entire build directory and start over - then
      you know with 100% confidence that no leftover settings will linger around to haunt you.</p>

    <h2>Curses CMake</h2>

    <p>Curses is a library that provides a psuedo-graphical user interface at the command line. Curses CMake (or
      ccmake) allows you to easily configure some options for your project before compiling it. Try running
      <code>ccmake -G &quot;Unix Makefiles &lt;source directory&gt;</code> next time and take a look.</p>

    <h2>Make Targets</h2>

    <p>A make “target” is a set of commands that you would like Make to execute for you. If you run Make with no
      arguments, a default target of “all” is chosen for you. Generally, the <code>all</code> target will
      compile your code. On the rare off-chance that you made some changes to your code and Make hasn't picked
      them up (and therefore is not recompiling them), giving Make the “clean” target will delete all compiled
      objects and let you start over (<code>make clean</code>). You can remove old files and recompile new
      ones
      in a single step with <code>make clean all</code> (order matters).</p>

    <p>PropWare provides two extra targets for your convenience.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <code>debug</code> target will compile your code, write it to your Propeller's HUB RAM and then
        start a serial terminal to
        aid in debugging your application. When you are finished, press any of the arrow keys on your
        keyboard
        (don't use
        <code>Control-C</code> - it doesn't seem to like that) and you will be returned to your normal
        command
        prompt.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>run</code> target will compile your code and load it into your Propeller's EEPROM.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Debugging CMake Configurations</h2>

    <p>After generating your Makefiles, try adding <code>VERBOSE=1</code> to your Make command. This will tell
      Make
      to print each command to the terminal before running it - rather than printing only a short summary of
      what is being done. The output is very verbose and can be cumbersome to read - but it is invaluable when
      determining what went wrong with your compilation. Full command: <code>make VERBOSE=1</code></p>
