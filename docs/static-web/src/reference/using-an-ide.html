    <h1>Using an IDE</h1>

    <p>Ensure PropWare and PropGCC are installed on your system prior to starting your IDE.</p>

    <h2>JetBrain's CLion</h2>

    <h3>First-Time Setup of CLion</h3>

    <p>CLion comes bundled with its own CMake package. This is great for most users, but PropWare requires extra files
      in the CMake installation directory. The following steps will configure CLion to always use PropWare's CMake
      installation. This only needs to be done once, but should be done prior to opening any PropWare projects. This
      step can be skipped by advanced users who have manually added PropWare's CMake scripts to the CMake search
      path.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Open <code>File</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Build, Execution, Deployment</code> &rarr;
        <code>Toolchains</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the <code>CMake executable:</code> from <code>Bundled CMake X.Y.Z</code> to <code>Custom:</code> and
        use the file dialogue to select the CMake executable shipped with PropWare. This can typically be found in
        <code>/usr/bin/cmake</code> in Mac and Linux or <code>C:\Program Files\PropWare\bin\cmake.exe</code> in
        Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can be confident that your CMake selection works when, after closing the file dialogue, CLion shows the
        version of CMake beneath the text box, such as <code>CMake version: 3.7.0</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Click <code>OK</code> to close the settings dialogue.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Creating a New Project</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Select <code>New Project</code>, either from the splash screen or the <code>File</code> menu.</li>
      <li>
        Select "C++ Executable" as the project template (should be selected as the default) and give your new
        project a location. The language standard box can be ignored.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the project template is created, open the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file and add a new line above
        the <code>project(...)</code> invocation: <code>find_package(PropWare REQUIRED)</code>. This will pull in the
        necessary CMake configuration for PropWare-based projects. Be sure to add this line <i>above</i> the
        <code>project(...)</code> invocation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the line is added and the file is saved (saving files is automatic by default in CLion), CLion will
        prompt you to reload CMake. "Enable Auto-Reload" is recommended for PropWare-based projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        With CMake now aware of PropWare and CLion now updated with CMake's new settings, change the CMake build
        configuration from the default <code>Debug</code> to <code>None</code>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open <code>File</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Build, Execution, Deployment</code> &rarr;
            <code>CMake</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the <code>Configuration:</code> to <code>None</code> and click <code>OK</code> to close the settings
            dialogue.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new folder will be created named <code>cmake-build-none</code>; this folder will be used for generated
            files such as object files and your executable. You can customize the name of this directory by providing a
            value to the <code>Generation path:</code> setting in the <code>CMake</code> options seen in the previous
            dialogue.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are done changing the settings for CMake, delete any unused folders in your project, such as
        <code>cmake-build-debug</code>. The one currently being used by your project will show up as as red folder
        with a yellow background - this color pattern shows you that CLion is not indexing any files in that
        directory.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Opening an Existing Project</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        To open an existing PropWare project, consider using CMake to generate Makefiles at least once prior to
        opening the project with CLion (that means create the build directory, <code>bin</code>, and run
        <code>cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..</code>). This can be done from within CLion, but may be easier on the
        command-line.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select <code>Open...</code> from the <code>File</code> menu or <code>Open Project</code> from the splash
        screen.
      </li>
      <li>Navigate to the <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file in the build directory and click <code>OK</code>.</li>
      <li>
        Select <code>Open as Project</code> at the following prompt. This option gives the best possible import, as
        CLion is able to read all of the settings that PropWare has already configured for the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the CMake build configuration from the default <code>Debug</code> to <code>None</code>:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open <code>File</code> &rarr; <code>Settings</code> &rarr; <code>Build, Execution, Deployment</code> &rarr;
            <code>CMake</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the <code>Configuration:</code> to <code>None</code> and click <code>OK</code> to close the settings
            dialogue.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new folder will be created named <code>cmake-build-none</code>; this folder will be used for generated
            files such as object files and your executable. You can customize the name of this directory by providing a
            value to the <code>Generation path:</code> setting in the <code>CMake</code> options seen in the previous
            dialogue.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are done changing the settings for CMake, delete any unused folders in your project, such as
        <code>cmake-build-debug</code>. The one currently being used by your project will show up as as red folder
        with a yellow background - this color pattern shows you that CLion is not indexing any files in that
        directory.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Preparing a PropWare Run Configuration</h3>

    <p>CLion does not yet have an inherent concept of embedded systems. It assumes that all executables in your
      project can be executed directly on the host system. Changes will need to be made to the auto-populated run
      configurations so that they execute via <code>propeller-load</code> rather than locally on the host.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><b>Warning</b> CLion's run console is buffered and there is no
      way to switch to an unbuffered console. For that reason, it is not well-suited to running Propeller
      applications that use an interactive console. It is recommended that you use CLion's built-in terminal (or
      your favorite terminal outside of CLion) to invoke PropWare's various Make targets such as
      <code>debug</code> to run any application on the Propeller that requires reading user input over a UART
      connection.</div>

      <ol>
      <li>Select <code>Edit Configurations...</code> from the drop-down in the top right of the project window.</li>
      <li>
        Select one of the configurations (there ought to be one which matches the name of your executable, and
        that is a fine one to start with) and choose <code>Select other...</code> from the <code>Executable:</code>
        dropdown list.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>Executable:</code> dropdown needs to be changed. The very bottom of the dropdown box will be an
        option named <code>Select other...</code>; choose it. A file dialogue will open and allow you to select
        <code>propeller-load</code>, which can typically be found in <code>/opt/parallax/bin/propeller-load</code> on
        Linux and Mac or <code>C:\PropGCC\bin</code> on Windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        For <code>Program arguments:</code>, enter <code>-b &lt;YOUR BOARD&gt; &lt;YOUR EXECUTABLE&gt; -r -t</code> where
        <code>&lt;YOUR BOARD&gt;</code> is the Propeller board you are using (see the
        <a ng-href="#/reference/cmake-reference#board">BOARD</a> variable in PropWare documentation) and <code>&lt;YOUR
        EXECUTABLE&gt;</code> is the file name of your executable. Typically, it is the first argument of your <code>
        create_simple_executable(...)</code> or <code>create_executable(...)</code>. An example of this might look
        like <code>-b activityboard Blinky_Demo -r -t</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>Working directory:</code> should also be set. Use the file dialogue to the right of the text box to
        select your project's build directory, such as <code>bin</code> or <code>cmake-build-none</code>.
      </li>
      <li>At the top-right of the window, ensure <code>Single instance only</code> is checked.</li>
      <li>
        Close the dialogue by clicking the <code>OK</code> button and press the play button in the top-right of CLion.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Eclipse CDT</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>For Eclipse users, ensure the C/C++ Developer Tools (CDT) plugin is installed; For new Eclipse
        users,
        find <code>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</code> <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">here
        </a> and download the appropriate package
      </li>
      <li>Create your <a href="build-system.html">CMakeLists.txt file</a>.</li>
      <li>For any source file that does not yet exist, create an empty file in its place. CMake will throw
        errors
        if your CMakeLists.txt file references any non-existing source files.
      </li>
      <li>At the terminal, enter your project's directory and type <code>cmake -G &quot;Eclipse CDT4 - Unix
        Makefiles&quot; .</code>. Notice that this time, we're adding a hook to tell CMake that we're using
        Eclipse. If you prefer another IDE, chekc the
        <a href="http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Generator_Specific_Information">CMake Wiki</a> to see if it
        is supported.
      </li>
      <li>Navigating the Eclipse import dialogue:</li>
      <li>Open Eclipse. In the <code>File</code> menu, select <code>Import...</code>.</li>
      <li>Under the <code>General</code> group should be an option <code>Existing Projects into
        Workspace</code> -
        select that option and choose <code>Next &gt;</code>.
      </li>
      <li>On the next page, ensure <code>Select root directory:</code> is selected at the top and then click
        <code>Browse...</code>. Find the parent folder of your project (for example, if your project is
        <code>C:\Users\David\Hello</code>, then choose <code>C:\Users\David</code>).
      </li>
      <li>At least one project should populate in the box below. Ensure your new PropWare project and only
        your
        new PropWare project is selected.
      </li>
      <li>Eclipse will import all necessary settings as soon as you click <code>Finish</code>. Compile flags,
        include directories and required source files will all be ready to go.
      </li>
      <li>Compiling your program and loading to EEPROM can be done easily from within Eclipse. Compiling is as
        simple as clicking the hammer icon or using <code>Control-B</code>. Writing to EEPROM requires
        creating a new Run Configuration.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>I do not recommend attempting to create a Run Configuration for PropWare's <code>debug</code>
        configuration. PropGCC's terminal does not play well with either Eclipse or JetBrains CLion. Use the
        terminal for debugging, exactly as described in "Starting a New Project" step 4.
      </li>
    </ul>
