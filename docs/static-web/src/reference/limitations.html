    <h2>Spin</h2>

    <p>There are many different ways to use Spin on the Propeller. With the help of Propeller forums, Iâ€™ve
      compiled
      a <a href="http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/157563-Combining-Spin-and-C">list</a> of all (most)
      of
      the different ways to use Spin and/or C/C++ within one project. Because there are so many different
      options, it will take quite some time before these options are available within PropWare. The first step
      is to determine how a user selects which method to use. Only when that is finalized can work begin on
      the
      implementation.</p>
    <p>Currently, PropWare support the following options for Spin files:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>DAT section extraction</dt>
      <dd>Extract the DAT section of a Spin file and incorporate it as a binary blob in the executable.</dd>
      <dt>Spin2Cpp</dt>
      <dd>Convert a Spin file to C++ source.</dd>
    </dl>
