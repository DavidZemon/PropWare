    <h1>Contribute to PropWare</h1>

    <p>Code contributions can be made by either <a href="mailto:david@zemon.name">contacting David Zemon</a> or
      forking the repository and creating a pull request. If you'd like to help but don't know how, start by
      perusing the <a href="https://github.com/parallaxinc/PropWare/issues/">issue tracker</a> and finding
      something that piques your interest.</p>

    <p>Before submitting your pull request, please be sure to read the following guidelines for PropWare's
      codebase.</p>

    <h2>Coding Style</h2>

    <h3>Whitespace</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Indentation is 4 spaces</li>
      <li>No indentation within <code>namespace</code></li>
      <li>One indentation for visibility keywords in a class</li>
      <li>One indentation relative to visibility keyword for members and methods of a class</li>
      <li>One empty line should separate every method in a class and every function definition.</li>
      <li>Members and methods of basic <code>struct</code>s with no visibility keywords are indented once
        relative
        to class declaration
      </li>
      <li>No empty line following visibility keywords.</li>
      <li>Variable declarations without empty lines between them should be aligned. An example of
        aligning variables looks like this:
        <pre><code hljs hljs-language="c++">const int     myInt = 0;
unsigned char myChar;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Use of empty lines between blocks of variable declarations is encouraged only when a logical distinction
        is being made between the blocks.
      </li>
      <li>Once empty line above and below a namespace declaration (including its closing brace).</li>
      <li>Never leave trailing whitespace</li>
      <li>Newlines are represented Unix-style, with a single newline (<code>\n</code>) character and no carriage return
        (<code>\r</code>).
      </li>
      <li>All files end with exactly one newline character (no excessive empty lines).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Brackets</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Open bracket is placed on the same line</li>
      <li>Closing bracket is placed on the next line</li>
      <li>Once space before opening bracket</li>
      <li>Single-line control statements (for, if, etc) should not use brackets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Naming Conventions</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Use of methods and member variables should be prefixed with <code>this-&gt;</code></li>
      <li>Method names use underscore, not camel case (<code>my_method</code>, not <code>myMethod</code>)</li>
      <li>Member variables are prefixed with <code>m_</code> and use camelCase (such as
        <code>m_myVariable</code>)
      </li>
      <li>Names are never abbreviated unless the name is excessively long or the only colloquial use is the acronym,
        such as “VGA” or “I2C”
      </li>
      <li>Class names use camel case, with the first letter capitalized (<code>MyClass</code>)</li>
      <li>Constant variables should be in all caps, separated by underscores (<code>MY_CONSTANT</code>)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Coding Best Practices</h2>

    <h3>Pass by Reference</h3>

    <p>Whenever feasible, choose pass-by-reference over pass-by-address. This helps to avoid the pointer syntax
      troubles that many programmers struggle with. It also helps to avoid the need for writing overridden equals
      operators. Pass-by-reference is not a good solution for optional parameters with default values of
      <code>NULL</code> in a method, such as the optional logger that can be provided to the filesystem classes.</p>

    <h3>enum class</h3>

    <p><code>enum class MyEnum {...};</code> should be preferred over <code>typedef enum {...} MyEnum;</code>.
      Exceptions to this rule are, however, frequent. <code>enum class</code> will be relegated to abstract
      concepts which are never or infrequently converted to their ordinal values. &quot;color&quot;s and
      &quot;mode&quot;s of operation are often good examples of a sufficiently abstract concept to use
      <code>enum class</code>. “Mode” would be a bad example, though, if the ordinal values represent specific
      bits in a register, and those bits need to be accessed frequently. The <code>enum class</code> is a
      method to <em>prevent automatic casting <em>down</em> to an <code>int</code></em>. Remember that
      standard
      <code>enum</code>s already avoid automatic casting up to the enum.</p>

    <h3>Memory Allocation: Static v. Dynamic</h3>

    <p>Dynamic memory allocation should be avoided at all costs - it is often an unnecessary complication in a
      program, and heavily inflates the size of a binary. Classes that require buffers (such as
      <code>PropWare::Runnable</code>) should use pass-by-reference combined with C++ templates to provide an easy
      way to pass statically allocated buffers:</p>

    <pre><code hljs hljs-language="c++" hljs-no-escape>template&lt;size_t N&gt;
Runnable(const uint32_t (&stack)[N])
    : m_stackPointer(stack),
      m_stackSizeInBytes(N * sizeof(uint32_t)) {
}</code></pre>

    <p>The above method only works for statically allocated memory. Any time this method is used, an overloaded
      version of the method should also be provided which accepts the address and size of the array as separate
      arguments:</p>

    <pre><code hljs hljs-language="c++" hljs-no-escape>Runnable(const uint32_t *stack, const size_t stackLength)
    : m_stackPointer(stack),
      m_stackSizeInBytes(stackLength * sizeof(size_t)) {
}</code></pre>
  </div>
</div>
