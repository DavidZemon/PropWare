      codebase.</p>

    <h2>Coding Style</h2>

    <h3>Whitespace &amp; Brackets</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Indentation is 4 spaces</li>
      <li>No indentation within <code>namespace</code></li>
      <li>One indentation for visibility keywords in a class</li>
      <li>One indentation relative to visibility keyword for members and methods of a class</li>
      <li>Members and methods of basic <code>struct</code>s with no visibility keywords are indented once
        relative
        to class declaration
      </li>
      <li>Open bracket is placed on the same line</li>
      <li>Closing bracket is placed on the next line</li>
      <li>Single-line statements should not use brackets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Coding Conventions</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Use of methods and member variables should be prefixed with <code>this-&gt;</code></li>
      <li>Method names use underscore, not camelCase</li>
      <li>Member variables are prefixed with <code>m_</code> and use camelCase (such as
        <code>m_myVariable</code>)
      </li>
      <li>Names are never abbreviated unless the name is excessively long or the acronym is only used
        colloquially, such as“VGA” or “SPI”
      </li>
      <li>Class names use CamelCase, with the first letter capitalized</li>
      <li>Constant variables should be in all caps, separated by underscores</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Coding Best Practices</h2>

    <h3>enum class</h3>

    <p><code>enum class MyEnum {...};</code> should be preferred over <code>typedef enum {...} MyEnum;</code>.
      Exceptions to this rule are, however, frequent. <code>enum class</code> will be relegated to abstract
      concepts which are never or infrequently converted to their ordinal values. &quot;color&quot;s and
      &quot;mode&quot;s of operation are often good examples of a sufficiently abstract concept to use
      <code>enum class</code>. “Mode” would be a bad example, though, if the ordinal values represent specific
      bits in a register, and those bits need to be accessed frequently. The <code>enum class</code> is a
      method to <em>prevent automatic casting <em>down</em> to an <code>int</code></em>. Remember that
      standard
      <code>enum</code>s already avoid automatic casting up to the enum.</p>
