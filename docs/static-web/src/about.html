    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>PropWare is a combination of three key pieces:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy, configurable and fast C/C++ objects for the Propeller, including objects from
        <ul>
          <li>My own PropWare namespace</li>
          <li>Parallax's <a href="https://github.com/parallaxinc/Simple-Libraries">C Simple Library</a></li>
          <li>SRLM's <a href="https://github.com/libpropeller/libpropeller">libpropeller</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/Martin-H1/libArduino">libArduino</a>, a port of the Arduino libraries</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>An easy-to-use and robust build system using CMake</li>
      <li>Thorough documentation and tutorials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Installation binaries make setup easy, and CMake functions make building complex applications quick. If you are
      an Eclipse user, CMake provides a simple command that will generate an Eclipse project (no need for a special
      Propeller plugin). Students can take free advantage of JetBrains' C++ IDE,
      (<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>), which supports CMake out-of-the-box and is the
      recommended tool for use with PropWare applications.</p>
    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I've drawn inspiration from a lot of different projects over the years, but there are three big ones that
      helped to form PropWare into what it is today.</p>
    <h3>Arduino</h3>
    <p>Arduino is the king of “easy” in the microcontroller world. Though they aren't the fastest, and they
      aren't the cheapest, they have a monopoly on documentation and users. I use
      <a href="https://www.arduino.cc" target="_blank">www.arduino.cc</a> as my benchmark for ease of use and
      documentation standards.</p>
    <h3>TI's TivaWare</h3>
    <p>My first introduction to a hardware abstraction layer was with TI's StellarisWare (now called TivaWare).
      It opened my eyes to a new world where I would be able to develop a complex application on a microcontroller,
      accessing all of its hardware peripherals, without needing to pull out the datasheet every minute. I aim to
      reproduce the same power and flexibility on the Parallax Propeller.</p>
    <h3>SRLM's libpropeller</h3>
    <p>SRLM's libpropeller was the wake up call that convinced me not only to use C++, but to use header files as much
      as possible. It has also given me a constant drive to add more peripherals and objects, simply for competition's
      sake, even before there were many users.</p>
    <h2>Goals and Aspirations</h2>
    <p>My goal is to provide both novice and expert users alike a single environment that approaches the
      simplicity of SimpleIDE or Arduino without compromising power or flexibility. I believe it is possible to create a
      single environment capable of introducing first-time programmers to the Propeller, as well as satisfying
      a commercial-grade applications. There are lots of ways PropWare doesn't fit into this vision currently,
      but it is an active and ongoing effort to make improvements every day.</p>
