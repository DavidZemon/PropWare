PropGCC SPI Demo - README

Example project to demonstrate various functions within PropWare's SPI module.

An SPI bus in master mode will be opened and the simple string "Hello world\n" 
will be sent to the slave. After sending each character, it will wait to receive
the same character back as an echo. Upon receiving the echo character, it will
be printed to the computer terminal.

After each iteration over the entire string, the 8 LEDs on the Quickstart board
will be toggled (likely only visible on an oscilloscope).
